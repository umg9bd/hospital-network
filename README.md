This Cisco Packet Tracer project is a basic hospital network topology (ring and star) with over 50 nodes, including servers, switches, routers, and security configurations. Ideal for students, looking to understand hospital networking, VLANs, and network security, this project provides a realistic simulation of a hospitalâ€™s IT infrastructure.

Key Features:																																																																																																														
1. 50+ Nodes: Includes PCs, laptops, and printers                                                                                                                             																						
2. Servers Included: HTTP and FTP servers configured.																																																																																			
3. Static Routing: Properly structured network traffic management.																																																																																						
4. Switching & Redundancy: Designed for minimal downtime and efficient communication. Proper Labeling & IP Addressing: All devices, VLANs, and connections are clearly labeled for easy understanding.								         																																																																																																								 5. Segmentation: Departments are logically separated for better security.																																																																																																																		
6. Dummy VPN Setup: A placeholder VPN is included, which can be configured if needed.(isolated but working properly) Scalable & Modifiable: Can be expanded based on project requirements.
